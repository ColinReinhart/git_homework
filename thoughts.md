1. Use my google calendar to ensure I schedule enough time to complete homework and projects. Break up the work so there are not huge blocks of time, but also not too short and be sure to make time for yourself.
2. ASK QUESTIONS. Do not wait more than half an hour of being stuck before reaching out to cohort or instructors for help.

1. Get more comfortable being uncomfortable.
2. Calendar practice. I don't have much to put into my calendar right now, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't practice.

Shoutout: Sarah in Mod 0 was Driving in our breakout and I goofed up a couple times Navigating. She was patient, and helped me understand where and why I goofed up. Thanks Sarah!
